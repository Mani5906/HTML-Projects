            In recent years India have had a few high-profile losses in knockout matches of world ODI events - the 2015 World Cup semi-final to Australia, the Champions Trophy final in 2017 to Pakistan, and the 2019 World Cup semi-final to New Zealand.
             <br> These losses have created the impression in the minds of some fans that the current Indian ODI side, good as it is, "doesn't come good when it matters"<div class="br"></div> 
             The claim is that there is some "mental" defect, some shortage of "bottle".We should all be suspicious of such claims.These claims are untestable (and therefore, unfalsifiable) because they speculate about the psychological make-up of strangers, based on a cursory view of the players in question on TV, and therefore amount to mind-reading. No professional psychologist would offer a diagnosis on the basis of such scant examination.These simple claims are emotionally deeply satisfying to the disappointed partisan fan - his team has lost, he has been humiliated, and this can only be because the players involved have some deficit as people. These claims about "failing on the big occasion" (another commonly used phrase) require no discussion of cricket. They go straight to the person.
